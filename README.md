My Deep Learning journey as a Computational Biologists

## Resourses that I use to learn transformer
* Coursera [attention-models-in-nlp](https://www.coursera.org/learn/attention-models-in-nlp/)  
  It introduces basic elements of transformer in a hard way at the first week. But you won't be able to have a deep understanding about transformer from it.
* Serrano.Academy 3 episode series about Natural Language Processing and Large Language Models  
  - [Video 1: The attention mechanism in high level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCpWwDCDFQ&t=0s)
  - [Video 2: The attention mechanism with math](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxCpWwDCDFQ&t=0s)
  - [Video 3: Transformer models](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaWMOYf4ri8&t=0s)
  This will help you to understand what's each matrix multiplication mean in transformer especially with the help of Video 2.   
* 3Blue1Brown [Attention in transformers, visually explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMlx5fFNoYc)  
  This explains the K,Q,V in more detail in some great virtual vissualization. I finally understand the dimensions and meanings of K,Q,V clearly.
* [王木头学科学](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGLr-TtKguA&t=3569s)  
  This is a chinese channel. It explains how attention works to understand language very well. He uses a few examples to help understand the importance of each matrice.

## AI labs in bio field
* [James J. Collins](https://www.collinslab.mit.edu/)
  - [Analyzing Learned Molecular Representations for Property Prediction, Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling 2019](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.9b00237)
    This paper applies graph neural networks to molecular property prediction
  - [Leveraging artificial intelligence in the fight against infectious diseases](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adh1114) A nice review summarize application of AI in therapeutics
